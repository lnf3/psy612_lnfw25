## Regression equation

$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots+b_kX_k$$

- regression coefficients are "partial" regression coefficients  

  - predicted change in $Y$ for a 1 unit change in $X$, .purple[holding all other predictors constant]
  
  - similar in interpretation to semi-partial correlation -- represents contribution to all of Y from unique part of each $X$
  
  - same statistical test as partial correlation -- unique variance of $Y$ explained by unique variance of each $X$

---

## example
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(here); library(tidyverse)
stress.data = read.csv(here("data/stress.csv")) %>% select(-group)
library(psych)
describe(stress.data, fast = T)
round(cor(stress.data),2)
```

---

## example

```{r, output.lines = c(9:13)}
mr.model <- lm(Stress ~ Support + Anxiety, data = stress.data)
summary(mr.model)
```


```{r}
# partial correlation tests
with(stress.data, ppcor::pcor.test(Stress, Support, Anxiety))
with(stress.data, ppcor::pcor.test(Stress, Anxiety, Support))
```
???

If a univariate regression is estimating the best-fit line, what is this estimating?

---
## Visualizing multiple regression

```{r}
library(visreg)

visreg2d(mr.model,"Support", "Anxiety", plot.type = "persp")

```

---

## Calculating coefficients 

Just like with univariate regression, we calculate the OLS solution. As a reminder, this calculation will yield the estimate that reduces the sum of the squared deviations from the line:

.pull-left[
### Unstandardized
$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_{1}X1 + b_{2}X_2$$
$$\large \text{minimize} \sum (Y-\hat{Y})^2 $$
]
.pull-right[

### Standardized
$$\large \hat{Z}_{Y} = b_{1}^*Z_{X1} + b_{2}^*Z_{X2}$$
$$\large \text{minimize} \sum (z_{Y}-\hat{z}_{Y})^2$$
]

---
## Calculating the standardized regression coefficient 

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

$$b_{2}^* = \frac{r_{Y2}-r_{Y1}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$



---

## Relationships between partial, semi- and $b*$  

(Standardized) Regression coefficients, partial correlations, and semi-partial correlations are all ways to represent the relationship between two variables while taking into account a third (or more!) variables. 

  - Each is a standardized effect, meaning the effect size is calculated in standardized units, bounded by -1 and 1*. This means they can be compared across studies, metrics, etc.

Note, however, that the calculations differ between the three effect sizes. These effect sizes are not synonymous and often yield different answers. 

  - if predictors are not correlated, $r$,  $sr$ $(r_{Y(1.2)})$ and $b*$ are equal 

.small[*Actually, standardized regression coefficients are not bounded by -1 and 1, but it's rare to see values this large, and [usually indicative of some multicollinearity](http://www.statmodel.com/download/Joreskog.pdf).]
---

** Standardized multiple regression coefficient** $b^*$

$$\large \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$


** Semi-partial correlation** $r_{y(1.2)}$
$$\large \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}}$$

** Partial correlation** $r_{y1.2}$
$$\large \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{{12}}}{\sqrt{1-r^2_{Y2}}\sqrt{1-r^2_{12}}}$$

---

```{r}
stress.data = stress.data %>%
  mutate(z_anxiety = scale(Anxiety),
         z_support = scale(Support),
         z_stress = scale(Stress))

mod0 = lm(z_stress ~ z_anxiety + z_support, 
          data = stress.data)

round(coef(mod0),3)
```

.pull-left[
```{r, message=F, warning = F, echo = 2:4}
library(ppcor)
spcor.test(x = stress.data$Stress, 
           y = stress.data$Anxiety, 
           z = stress.data$Support)$estimate
```
]

.pull-right[

```{r, message=F, warning = F}
pcor.test(x = stress.data$Stress, 
          y = stress.data$Anxiety, 
          z = stress.data$Support)$estimate
```

]
---
    
## Original metric

$$b_{1} = b_{1}^*\frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X1}}$$

$$b_{1}^* = b_{1}\frac{s_{X1}}{s_{Y}}$$

### Intercept

$$b_{0} = \bar{Y} - b_{1}\bar{X_{1}} - b_{2}\bar{X_{2}}$$

## Estimating model fit

```{r, highlight.output = 18}
mr.model <- lm(Stress ~ Support + Anxiety, data = stress.data)
summary(mr.model)
```

---

```{r}
library(broom); library(scales)
stress.data1 = augment(mr.model)
stress.data1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Stress, y = .fitted)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(Stress), color = "bar(Y)")) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(color = "R[bar(Y)][Y]")) + scale_x_continuous("Y (Stress)") + scale_color_discrete(labels = parse_format()) + scale_y_continuous(expression(hat(Y))) + theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

## Multiple correlation, R

$$\large \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}$$


- $\hat{Y}$ is a linear combination of Xs
- $r_{Y\hat{Y}}$ = multiple correlation = R

--

$$\large R = \sqrt{b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}}$$
$$\large R^2 = {b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}}$$

## Decomposing sums of squares

We haven't changed our method of decomposing variance from the univariate model

$$\Large \frac{SS_{regression}}{SS_{Y}} = R^2$$
$$\Large {SS_{regression}} = R^2({SS_{Y})}$$



$$\Large {SS_{residual}} = (1- R^2){SS_{Y}}$$
  
---

## significance tests

- $R^2$ (omnibus)  
- Regression Coefficients  
- Increments to $R^2$  
    
---

## R-squared, $R^2$


- Same interpretation as before  

- Adding predictors into your model will increase $R^2$ â€“ regardless of whether or not the predictor is significantly correlated with Y.

  - Think back to sampling error. If the population correlation, $\rho$, is 0, will your sample estimate always be 0? 

- Adjusted/Shrunken $R^2$ takes into account the number of predictors in your model  


---

## Adjusted R-squared, $\text{Adj } R^2$

$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$

- What happens if you add many IV's to your model that are uncorrelated with your DV?

--


- What happens as you add more covariates to your model that are highly correlated with your key predictor, X?

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$


---

## ANOVA

```{r, highlight.output = 19}
summary(mr.model)
```
---

## ANOVA

The omnibus test uses all SS associated with predictors.

```{r, highlight.output = 5:6}
anova(mr.model)
```
```{r, echo = F}
aov_mod = anova(mr.model)
ss_model = sum(aov_mod$`Sum Sq`[1:2])
ms_model = ss_model/2
Fstat = ms_model/aov_mod$`Mean Sq`[3]
```

$$SS_{\text{model}} = `r round(ss_model,2)`$$
$$MS_{\text{model}} = \frac{SS_{\text{model}}}{df_{\text{model}}} = `r round(ms_model,2)`$$
$$F_{\text{model}} = \frac{MS_{\text{model}}}{MS_{\text{residual}}} = `r round(Fstat,2)`$$
---

## ANOVA

The omnibus test uses all SS associated with predictors.

```{r, highlight.output = 5:6}
anova(mr.model)
```

Note that the _p_-values in this table do NOT match the _p_-values in the regression summary table. For the time being, just know that, in a multiple regression framework, you should use the `summary()` output to interpret the unique contribution of predictors, not the `anova()` output. We'll return to these calculations later in the term and discuss them in more detail.

## Standard errors

$$\Large H_{0}: \beta_{X}= 0$$
$$\Large H_{1}: \beta_{X} \neq 0$$

---

## Standard error of regression coefficient

In the case of univariate regression:

$$\Large se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-r_{xy}^2}{n-2}}}$$

In the case of multiple regression:

$$\Large se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}^2}}$$

- As N increases... 
- As variance explained increases... 

---

$$se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}^2}}$$

## Tolerance

$$1-R_{i.jkl...p}^2$$

- Proportion of $X_i$ that does not overlap with other predictors.
    - Bounded by 0 and 1

- Large tolerance (little overlap) means standard error will be small.   

- what does this mean for including a lot of variables in your model? 

---

## Tolerance in `R`

```{r}
library(olsrr)

ols_vif_tol(mr.model)
```

Why are tolerance values identical here?

---

## Which variables to include

- You goal should be to match the population model (theoretically)

- Including many variables will not bias parameter estimates but will potentially increase degrees of freedom and standard errors; in other words, putting too many variables in your model may make it _more difficult_ to find a statistically significant result 

- But that's only the case if you add variables unrelated to Y or X; there are some cases in which adding the wrong variables can lead to spurious results. [Stay tuned for the lecture on causal models.]
